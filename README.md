FITS_GUI
========

FITS is a command-line tool that identifies, validates, and extracts technical metadata 
for various file formats. It wraps several third-party open source tools, normalizes and 
consolidates their output, and reports any errors. FITS was created by the Harvard 
University Library Office for Information Systems for use in its Digital Repository Service 
(DRS). 

FITS_GUI is a GUI (graphic user interface) for running FITS. It saves the results as OUTPUT.txt.

Must have fits.bat installed in the same folder as FITS_GUI. You can download fits.bat here:
